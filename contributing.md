# Contributing to PC CARE

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help is what makes the open-source community thrive.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pc-care/issues). If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue with the "enhancement" label. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it would be beneficial, and a potential implementation if you have one.

### Pull Requests
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

Please make sure your code adheres to the existing style and that all tests pass.
