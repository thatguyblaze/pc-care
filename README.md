(Computer Assistance & Repair Engine)

About The Project
PC CARE was built to provide a simple, powerful, and transparent solution for Windows PC maintenance. Commercial PC cleaning software can often be bloated, expensive, or untrustworthy. This project brings the most effective and widely-accepted system maintenance tasks into a single, easy-to-use script that follows professional software design principles.

The entire application is architected using modern Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to ensure it is stable, maintainable, and easily expandable.

Key Features
General Cleaning: Safely removes temporary system and user files to free up disk space.

System Repair & Optimization:

SFC Scan: Scans and repairs corrupted or missing protected system files.

Ultimate Performance: Activates the hidden Windows power plan for maximum performance, ideal for gaming and demanding applications.

Flush DNS: Resolves internet connectivity issues by clearing the DNS cache.

Game Specific Fixes:

Targeted, community-approved fixes for popular games like Helldivers 2 to resolve common issues like stuttering or configuration problems.

System Information: Generates a quick, detailed report of your hardware (CPU, RAM, GPU, OS).

Safe & Secure: Built with administrator privilege checks and user confirmations for sensitive operations.
